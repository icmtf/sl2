# About CodeHorizon Project

This project is a comprehensive application stack that includes:

1. A Nginx frontend that acts as Reverse Proxy
2. A Streamlit dashboard for data visualization
3. A FastAPI backend for handling API requests
4. Redis for caching and data storage
5. EasyNet worker for processing network device data
6. S3 worker for handling S3 bucket operations
7. MkDocs for project documentation

Our goal is to provide a robust and scalable solution for presenting data that supports INET daily tasks and related data.
The combination of these technologies allows us to create a powerful and user-friendly system for monitoring, analyzing, and documenting our network infrastructure.
